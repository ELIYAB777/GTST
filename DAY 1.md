**Ethical Hacking**

Ethical hacking the practice of identifying weaknesses in computer systems and networks to find out threats and vulnerabilities that a malicious attacker may find and exploit, causing loss of data, financial loss, or other major damages. 
The purpose of ethical hacking is to improve the security of the network or systems by fixing the vulnerabilities found during testing.

**Types of Hackers**

1. **White Hat Hackers**: These are ethical hackers who use their skills to identify vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks and report them to the owners of the system so that they can be fixed. They work to improve the security of the system and prevent malicious attacks.

2. **Black Hat Hackers**: These are malicious hackers who use their skills to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks for personal gain or to cause harm. They exploit vulnerabilities in the system to steal data, money, or cause damage.

3. **Grey Hat Hackers**: These are hackers who operate between the white hat and black hat hackers. They may identify vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks without permission, but they do not use the information for personal gain or to cause harm. They may report the vulnerabilities to the owners of the system or use them to gain recognition.

**Saving Notes using Version Control and Connecting it with GitHub Desktop and Obsidian**

Version control is a system that allows you to keep track of changes made to a file or a set of files over time. Git is a popular version control system that allows you to track changes made to your files and collaborate with others on a project. GitHub Desktop is a graphical user interface for Git that makes it easy to manage your repositories and collaborate with others. Obsidian is a note-taking app that allows you to create and organize our notes in a hierarchical structure.

To save our notes using version control and connect it with GitHub Desktop and Obsidian, we should follow these steps:

1. Install Git on your computer and create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.

2. Create a new repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine using GitHub Desktop.

3. Open Obsidian and create a new vault in the directory where you cloned your repository.

4. Create a new note in Obsidian and save it in the vault. Obsidian will automatically create a markdown file for the note.

5. In GitHub Desktop, commit the changes made to the markdown file and push them to the remote repository on GitHub.

6. Your notes are now saved in the remote repository on GitHub and can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.

By using version control and connecting it with GitHub Desktop and Obsidian, We can easily manage your notes, collaborate with others, and keep track of changes made to your files over time.
